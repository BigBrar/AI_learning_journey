Probability - 
Probability means the chances or percentage for a certain event to happen. It means the chances of a certain event happening.

Here are some of the attributes required to calculate probability - 

*Trials - All of the events that occurred.
*Event - A certain type or kind of event that occurred in trials.

		
					FOR EXAMPLE - 
A coin is tossed 1000 times. 445 times the result is tail and 555 times the result is heads.

					So applying the attributes - 
Trials = 1000
Events = Tails(445), Heads(555)

					Calculating probability - 
Now to calculate the probability for a certain event we can use this predefined formula that uses trials and events to get the probability of that event happening.

					Formula - 

Probability(event) = Events/Trials


so in the earlier case of heads and tails let's calculate the probability for heads - 

555(heads)/1000(trials) = 0.555(heads probability)

445(tails)/1000(trials) = 0.445(tails probability)


Another thing to keep in mind is that all the events can be calculated and each will have its own probability.
NOTE - Now if you add up the probability of all the events the result will always be 1.
					For example - 
probability of heads = 0.555
probability of tails = 0.445 
addition of both turns into = 1
