Quartiles are basically three points which divide the data into four equal parts, when it has been orderly arranged.

Q1 = first quartile
Q2 = second quartile
Q3 = third Quartile

each quartile holds 25% of the data. 

lowest to q1 = 25%
q1 to q2 = 25%
q2 to q3 = 25%
q3 to highest = 25%



Interquartile Range (IQR)
The data range that contains the middle 50% of the entries.
IQR = Q3 - Q1

min = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
max = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

The values which are below Q1 - IQR or above Q3 - IQR are outliers. 

	This is called 1.5 X IQR rule.
